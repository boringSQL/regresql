# regresql ignore file
# works similar to .gitignore, this file specifies patterns for SQL files
# and directories that regresql should ignore during discovery.
#
# Syntax:
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#   - Patterns use gitignore-style syntax:
#     * matches any files or directories
#     ** matches directories recursively
#     / at the start means match from root only
#     / at the end means directory only
#
# Examples:

# Ignore all test files
*_test.sql

# Ignore specific file
random_migration_script.sql

# Ignore entire directory (from root)
/db/migrations

# Ignore any 'drafts' directory anywhere
drafts/

# Ignore all files in examples recursively
examples/**/*.sql

# Ignore files matching a pattern
temp_*.sql
backup_*.sql
